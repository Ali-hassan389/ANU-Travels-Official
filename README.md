## 📖 The Story of ANU

**ANU Travels** is not just a codebase; it is a digital gateway to the world. Born from the shared passion of its founders—**A**li, **N**afia, and **U**zwa—this project represents the "Golden Bird" of freedom and the majesty of mountains.

Our goal was to move away from the clutter of traditional travel sites and create a **User Experience** that feels like a premium concierge service: elegant, simple, and inspiring.



## 🏗️ Project Architecture

Unlike standard single-page websites, ANU Travels utilizes a **Modular Directory Structure**. Each section of the website acts as an independent module with its own assets, creating a clean and organized development environment.

## 🌟 Core Functionalities

### 1. The "Golden Bird" Visuals
We prioritized high-resolution imagery and a **Teal & White (#355c5c)** color palette to evoke nature and tranquility. The layout uses CSS Grid to ensure images of Bali, Italy, and Dubai look stunning on both mobile phones and 4K desktop screens.

### 2. Smart Booking System
The booking page isn't just a static form. It includes **Client-Side Validation** via vanilla JavaScript:
* ✅ Prevents submission of empty fields.
* ✅ Enforces age restrictions (18+).
* ✅ Limits ticket quantities (Max 5).
* ✅ Provides instant visual feedback to the user.

### 3. Curated Destination Hubs
Instead of a generic list, we created dedicated detail pages for our top-tier destinations. Each page offers a unique itinerary breakdown, pricing models, and specific "What's Included" icon sets.
